The Astronaut Schedule App is a task management system designed specifically for astronauts to efficiently manage their daily tasks during space missions. Each astronaut can log in, create tasks, prioritize them, edit task details, and mark tasks as completed. This system ensures no task overlaps and allows tasks to be organized based on priority levels.
